I came across this Abraham Lincoln quote today:
 

> "Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle."


It sparked all sorts of notions in me. I love that it sounds like it could have been said today. If I didn't attribute it, you might wonder if it was from Elon Musk. Or perhaps Steve Jobs. 
 

What I really love is that it remindeds us that our generation, this 50 odd miles of San Francisco city and peninsula, didn't invent the hustle. We didn't come up with forging new things from just the sweat of one's brow. That we aren't the first to want to change our world. That it's just part of being human and long after everything around us crumbles, there will be people, and there will be hustle.
